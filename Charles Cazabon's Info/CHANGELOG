Version 4.04M  (Macintosh port of memtester 4.0.4)
05 September 2004 Tony Scaminaci

  - Changed memory reduction algorithm for single-user mode
    from a fixed 17M to a percentage (2.3%) of installed memory
    in order to eliminate lock-ups of the Darwin kernel

  - made memtester's exit code meaningful.  See the manpage for its meaning.
    Thanks to Wurzel Parsons-Keir, who sent a patch for the code, so I only had
    to document it (Charles).
